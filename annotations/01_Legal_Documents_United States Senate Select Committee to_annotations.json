The zeal with\nwhich the Congress has guarded and defended its own prerogatives\nand independence is a clear indication of its support of that doctrine\nwhere the Congress is involved.\nI believe, however,\nit\nis consistent with my view of the respective\npowers and privileges of the President and Congress for me to reply\nvoluntarily to the Committee's request for information. In responding,\nI may be able to\nassist the Committee\nin\nits very\ndifficult task of\nevaluating the\nintelligence community of this nation. By doing so\nvoluntarily, future Presidents or former Presidents need not be con-\ncerned that by this precedent they may be compelled to respond to\ncongressional demands.\nWhether\nit\nis wise\nfor a President, in his discretion, to provide\ntestimony concerning his presidential actions, is a matter which must\nbe decided by each President in light of the conditions at that time.\nUndoubtedly, as has been the case during the 200 years of this nation's\nhistory, the instances warranting such action may be rare. But when\nthe appropriate circumstances arise, each President must feel confident\nthat he can act in a spirit of cooperation, if he so decides, without\nimpairing either the stature or independence of his successors.\nFinally, I believe\nit\nis appropriate to inform the Committee that\nthe responses which follow are based totally upon my present recol-\nlection of events\u2014many of which were relatively insignificant in com-\nparison to the principal activities for which I had responsibility as\nPresident\u2014relating to a period some six years ago. Despite the dif-\nficulty in responding\nto questions purely from memory, I wish\nto\nassure the Committee that my responses represent an effort to respond\nas fully as possible.\nInterrogatory\n1.\u2014Please\nstate whether, while\nPresident, you\nre-\nceived information that, at any time during your Administration, an\nagency or employee of the United States Government, acting without\na warrant, opened mail\nA.

It is quite obvi-\nous that there are certain inherently governmental actions\nwhich\nif undertaken by the sovereign in protection of the\ninterest\nof\nthe\nnation's\nsecurity\nare\nlawful but which\nif\nundertaken by private persons are not. In the most extreme\ncase, for example, forceable removal of persons from their\nhomes for the purpose of sequestering them in confined areas,\nif\ndone by\na\nperson\u2014or\neven\nby government employees\nunder normal circumstances\u2014would be considered kidnap-\nping and unlawful imprisonment. Yet under the exigencies\nof war, President Roosevelt, acting pursuant to a broad war-\npowers delegation from\nCongress, ordered such\naction\nbe\ntaken\nagainst Americans of Japanese ancestry because he\nbelieved it to be in the interest of national security. Similarly\nunder extreme conditions but not at that point constituting\na declared war, President Lincoln confiscated vessels violat-\ning a naval blockade, seized rail and telegraph lines leading\nto Washington, and paid troops from Treasury funds without\nthe required\ncongressional\nappropriation. In\n1969, during\nmy Administration, warrantless wiretapping, even by the\ngovernment, was unlawful, but\nif undertaken because of a\npresidential determination that\nit was in the interest of na-\ntional security was lawful. Support for the legality of such\naction\nis found, for example, in the concurring opinion of\nJustice White in Katz v. United States.\nThis is not to say, of course, that any action a president\nmight authorize in the\ninterest of national security would\nbe\nlawul. The Supreme\nCourt's\ndisapproval\nof\nPresident\nTruman's seizure of the steel mills is an example. But\nit\nis\nnaive to attempt to categorize\nactivities a president might\nauthorize\nas\n\"legal\" or\n\"illegal\"\nwithout\nreference\nto\nthe\ncircumstances under which he concludes that the activity\nis\nnecessary.

I was aware that at that time the\nincumbent Administration in the United States determined\nthat\nit was\nin the\ninterests of\nthis nation to impede Mr.\nAllende's becoming president because of his alignment with\nand support from various communist countries, especially\nCuba. It is important to remember, of course, that President\nKennedy, only two years before, had faced the Cuban crisis\nin which\nthe Soviet Union had gained a military base of\noperations in the Western Hemisphere and had even begun\ninstallation of nuclear\nmissiles. The expansion of Cuban-\nstyled communist infiltration into Chile w\nrould have provided\na \"beachhead\"\nfor\nguerrilla\noperations throughout South\nAmerica. There was a great deal of concern expressed in 1964\nand again in 1970 by neighboring South American countries\nthat\nif Mr.\nAllende were\nelected\npresident,\nChile would\nquickly become a haven for communist operatives who could\ninfiltrate and undermine independent governments through-\nout South America. I wras aware that the Administrations\nof\nPresident\nKennedy\nand\nPresident\nJohnson\nexpended\napproximately four million dollars on behalf of Mr. Allende's\nopponents and had prevented Mr. Allende from becoming\nPresident.\nIt was in this context that in September 1970, after Mr.\nAllende had received a plurality but not a majority of the\ngeneral electorate's votes, that I determined that the C.I.A.\nshould attempt to bring about Mr. Allende's defeat in the\ncongressional election procedure. The same national security\ninterests\nwhich\nI\nhad\nunderstood\nprompted\nPresidents\nKennedy and Johnson to act from 1962-1964, prompted my\nconcern and the decision to act in 1970."

I recall assuring\nMr. Helms he was doing the right thing in defending the\nC.I.A. and\nthat he would have my\nfull\nsupport\ndespite\ncriticism. Therefore, I assured the Director that the White\nHouse would support the C.LA.'s position in opposing such\ndisclosures. As I recall,\nit was in light of this incident that,\non June 23, 1972, I made the statement to H. E. Haldeman\nreferred to\nin this interrogatory."

The Committee would welcome your comments and\nsuggestions\nas\nto the\nstructure,\norganization, and function of the\nUnited States intelligence community, or any part of\nit, including\nany statement as to ways in which improvements might be made.\nAttached at Tab G is a copy of S. Res. 21, the Resolution pursuant\nto which the Committee was established. Section 2 of the Resolution\nexpressly authorizes and directs the Committee to investigate certain\nenumerated matters relating to the intelligence community. The Com-\nmittee would\nalso welcome your comments with respect to any of\nthese enumerated matters.\nIn 1947 as a \"freshman\" Congressman and member of the\nHerter Committee, I visited a devastated European conti-\nnent. Seeing Berlin in the agonies of partition and seeing\nindeed, seeing Europe emerge from war in an age of stark\nidealogical conflict\u2014all these as well as other factors fostered\nmy firm belief in the need for a strong, determined, and ef-\nfective intelligence system during a period of Cold war.\nThe world has changed since 1947, and I have been privi-\nleged to have played a role in much of that change. Tragi-\ncally, however, there is much that has not changed. The reali-\nties of international relations have not lessened our need for\nintelligence. Throughout history, where the great powers are\nconcerned, during a period of detente the danger of war goes\ndown but the danger of conquest without war goes up.\nConsequently, I have found recent\nefforts to emasculate\nthe Central Intelligence Agency and related intelligence or-\nganizations to be not only incredibly short-sighted but poten-\ntially dangerous to the security of all free nations. The great-\nest disservice of the Select Committee would be to take any\naction or make any recommendation which would diminish\nby the\nslightest degree the\ncapabilities of our intelligence\ncommunity.\nEven as a distant observer I can say without reservation\nthat the revelations and investigations over the past year have\nhad the obvious effect of lessening United States intelligence\ncapabilities in the world.\nEven the least sophisticated among us can see that morale\namong these essential public servants\nis probably at an all-\ntime low.\nThe secrecy that is crucial to a successful intelligence sys-\ntem has been routinely\nviolated, causing in many quarters\na casual\nindifference to the need for security. For the na-\ntional media to publish and disseminate classified national\nsecurity information is in my view irresponsible journalism.\nItaly under the severe\nCommunist takeover;"

I am\ncertain that other governments' readiness to accept our word\nas bond and to be assured that we can keep their confidences\nhave steadily diminished. What new opportunities have been\nlost or what unwished consequences we might have suffered\nbecause of constant attacks in the media and by the Congress\nare not possible to know. It is all too likely that we will learn\nof them \"the hard way.\"\nI realize it is in vogue to rail against covert activities and\nclandestine\noperations. Some have even\nrhetorically\nques-\ntioned the very need for secrecy in the conduct of foreign af-\nfairs. Perhaps there was a time when some of this criticism\nwas necessary or even helpful. However, I think that para-\nphrasing an old aphorism\nis apt here: nothing exceeds like\nexcess.\nThe pendulum has swung too far. Were today's conditions\nin existence seven years ago it is highly questionable whether\nthe historic new opening could have been made to the Peo-\nple's Republic\nof China.\nEfforts\nto get the\nreturn of our\nPOW's and achieve an honorable peace in Vietnam might\nwell have been\naborted.\nSignificant new\ninitiatives\nin the\nMiddle East would have been delayed. Nuclear arms limita-\ntions and other agreements with the Soviet Union\u2014difficult\nachievements under the best of conditions\u2014would have been\nmuch more difficult.\nTherefore, I make the following recommendations.\n1. That Congressional oversight responsibilities, which are\nappropriate as a mechanism for legislative participation in\nthe policy decisions affecting intelligence activities, be dele-\ngated to a joint committee consisting of not more than twelve\nSenators and Representatives.\n2. That no information or material made available to the\njoint oversight committee be made available to any Congres-\nsional staff member, except the staff of the joint committee,\nwhich should be limited to not more than six members.\n3. That a statute be enacted making it a criminal violation\nto reveal to any unauthorized person information classified\npursuant to applicable law or executive order.\n4. That a committee consisting of representatives from each\nof the intelligence agencies be established to coordinate their\nrespective activities.\n5. That the joint intelligence committee study the question\nof the extent to which continued limitations on C.LA. do-\nmestic\nintelligence\nactivities, where there\nis\na\ndirect con-\nnection to matters of foreign espionage, sabotage or coun-\nterintelligence, should be continued.\nFreedom\nwithout\nsecurity\nproduces\nanarchy.\nSecurity\nwithout freedom produces dictatorship.

Failure to provide this balance has been\nthe cause for the failure of democratic governments to sur-\nvive in many other parts of the world.\nThe Executive, the Congress, and the Judiciary have in-\nherited a great legacy and have a special responsibility to\nmaintain that balance so that our American system of gov-\nernment\nwill continue to survive in a time when security\nand freedom are in jeopardy\nat home and abroad.\nIt\nis important\nat\nthis time to step back and assess not\nonly what action should or must be taken with respect to a\nparticular\nmatter,\nbut\nalso\nthe\nimmediate\ncircumstances\nwhich seem to compel that action be taken at all.

It was agreed by both parties that the following interrogatories\nwould be submitted to former President Nixon at San Clemente for\nhis written response. They were submitted on February 2, 1976, and\nthe Committee\nreceived\nthe former\nPresident's notarized\nresponse\non March 9, 1976.\nOpening Statement\nThe\nfollowing\nsubmission\nof\nresponses\nto\nthe\ninterrogatories\npropounded to me by the Senate Select Committee to Study Govern-\nmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, as was my\noffer to meet informally with the ranking members of the Committee\nto discuss any matter within the Committee's jurisdiction,\nis made\nvoluntarily and following careful consideration of the propriety of\na former President responding to Congressional questions pertaining\nto activities which occurred during his term in office.\nIt is my opinion that Congress cannot compel a President to testify\nconcerning\nthe\nconduct\nof\nhis\noffice,\neither\nin\njustification\nor\nin\nexplanation of actions he took. The existence of such power in the\nCongress would, without doubt, impair the Executive and his sub-\nordinates in the exercise of the constitutional responsibilities of the\nPresidency. The end results would be most unfortunate. The totally\nuninhibited flow of communication which\nis essential to the Execu-\ntive Branch would be so chilled as to render candid advice unobtain-\nable. No President could carry out his responsibilities if the advice\nhe received were to be filtered by the prospect of compelled disclosure\nat a future date. The result would be the interference and interruption\nof the open and frank interchange which is absolutely essential for\na President to fulfill his duties.\nAs President Truman stated in a letter to a Congressional committee\nin 1953, this principle applies to a former President as well as to a\nsitting President.\nIn his words:\nIt must be obvious to you that if the doctrine of separation\nof powers and the independence of the Presidency is to have\nany validity at all, it must be equally applicable to a Presi-\ndent after his term of office has expired when he is sought to\nbe examined with respect to any acts occurring while he is\nPresident.\n(143)"
